Single page site for The Engineering Studio. The design is using [Alembic](https://alembic.darn.es/) by [David Darnes](https://github.com/daviddarnes) theme as a [GitHub Pages remote theme](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-remote-theme), but with the following changes:

- Custom configuation in the `_config.yml`
- Replaced `site-aside.html` with custom content
- Set new colours in `_sass/_settings.scss`, which required `_sass/alembic.scss` and `assets/styles.scss` to expose it over the theme

_Please refer to the [GitHub Pages remote theme steps](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic#installation) for how this was installed and setup. Here you can also see how to customise and extend upon the theme._
